# Deep Neural Network
  
**Initialization**
  
* The weight and bias matrices for all the layers of the neural network must be initialised randomly .  
* Done using the np.random.randn() in the code.  
* The dimensions of the matrices must be properly checked for each of the layers .
  
**Forward Propagation**
